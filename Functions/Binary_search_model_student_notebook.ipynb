Its ability to halve the search space with every iteration is what makes it so efficient. With every iteration we are searching a smaller and more manageable subspace. \n","\n","Over and above being able to locate items in a discrete list, it can also be applied on a continuous domain. For this question, you will be required to use the binary search to find the root of some function $f(x)$ on the domain $x \\in [a,b]$  by continuously bisecting the domain. In our case, the root of the function can be defined as the x-values where the function will return 0, i.e. $f(x) = 0$\n","\n","For example, for the function: $f(x) = sin^2(x)x^2-2$ on the domain $[0,2]$, the root can be found at $x \\approx 1.43$. \n","\n","**Constraints**\n"," - Stopping criteria: $\\big| f(root) \\big| < 0.0001$ or you reach a maximum of 1000 iterations.\n"," - Round your answer to two decimal places. \n","\n","**Function specifications**\n","\n","*Argument(s):*\n","- **f** `(function)` $\\rightarrow$ mathematical expression in the form of a lambda function.\n","- **domain** `(tuple)` $\\rightarrow$ the domain of the function given a set of two integers.\n","- **MAX** `(int)` $\\rightarrow$ the maximum number of iterations that will be performed by the function.\n","\n","*Return:*\n","- **root** `(float)` $\\rightarrow$ return the root (**rounded to two decimals**) of the given function."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"metadata":{"id":"Mn1cTh8nbMFA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1652044356383,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":574,"user":{"displayName":"Mahomed Saajid Cassim","userId":"03411706528132358067"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["### START FUNCTION\n","def binary_search(f, domain, MAX = 1000):\n","    start, end = domain\n","    if start >= end:\n","        raise ValueError(\"Domain is empty\")\n","    mid = (start + end) / 2\n","    fstart = f(start)\n","    fend = f(end)\n","    fmid = f(mid)\n","    step = 0\n","    while abs(fmid) > 0.0001 and step < MAX:\n","        if (fmid < 0) != (fend < 0):  \n","            start = mid\n","            fstart = fmid\n","        else:\n","            end = mid\n","            fend = fmid\n","        mid = (start + end) / 2\n","        fmid = f(mid)\n","        step += 1\n","    return round(mid, 2)\n","### END FUNCTION"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"xb6XeJC-bMFA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1652044358702,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Mahomed Saajid Cassim","userId":"03411706528132358067"}},"outputId":"46a0812a-6a07-4b03-f0c5-aa1d2b9df79d"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1.43"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}],"source":["f = lambda x:(np.sin(x)**2)*(x**2)-2\n","domain = (0,2)\n","x=binary_search(f,domain)\n","x"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cmTMm5SVbMFB"},"source":["***Expected output***\n","```python\n","binary_search(lambda x:(np.sin(x)**2)*(x**2)-2,(0,2))==1.43\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"tJsggJTybMFC"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"interpreter":{"hash":"6b5ebbc2c6bde2831bc6c0426f75aca8137ccfc69d329557556ed73faee126ae"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.8"},"colab":{"name":"Binary_search_model_student_notebook.ipynb","provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
