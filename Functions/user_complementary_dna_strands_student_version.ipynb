DNA differs from RNA because RNA is one strand compared to DNA which is double stranded.It also differs in that instead of the U nucleotide, it contains a T. Below is an example of the different structures taken from: https://byjus.com/biology/difference-between-dna-and-rna/:\n","\n","The same lab was extremely impressed with the first code and now wants a new one. They want to find the complementary strands of DNA. Here is the low-down:\n","\n","A links with T and vice versa\n","C links with G and vice versa\n","An example of the complementary strand for the code ATCGGAATGCC is TAGCCTTACGG\n","\n","You are tasked to create a function dna_complementary which finds the complementary strand for a given DNA strand based on the above criteria. The function must return a string of the code\n","\n","This kind of code can be really helpful as a product. Imagine trying to get DNA strands for thousands of sequences which are thousands of nucleotides long. This is the power of python and coding!\n","\n","**Hint**: We didn't teach you dictionaries for nothing"],"metadata":{"id":"qlI5Syl4MM9k"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["from IPython.display import Image\n","from IPython.core.display import HTML \n","Image(url = 'https://github.com/Explore-AI/Pictures/blob/master/Difference-Between-DNA-and-RNA.png?raw=true')"],"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<img src=\"https://github.com/Explore-AI/Pictures/blob/master/Difference-Between-DNA-and-RNA.png?raw=true\"/>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Image object>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":1}],"metadata":{"id":"aQQqG_fIMM9l","outputId":"5af26a49-430e-4fb6-903a-6e30a85bedd1"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":43,"source":["### START FUNCTION\n","def dna_complementary(dna):\n","    # your code here\n","  complements = {'A':'T', 'T':'A', 'C':'G', 'G':'C'}\n","    \n","  reverse = reversed(dna)\n","  reverse = [complements[i] for i in dna]\n","\n","  return ''.join(reverse)\n","### END FUNCTION"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"_5wPET7pMM9n","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649711479619,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":389,"user":{"displayName":"Mahomed Saajid Cassim","userId":"03411706528132358067"}}}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":44,"source":["dna_complementary('ATCGGAATGCC') == 'TAGCCTTACGG'"],"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":44}],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-5tLmyEGMM9o","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649711482478,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Mahomed Saajid Cassim","userId":"03411706528132358067"}},"outputId":"baba68db-bb51-479b-adef-30b4f58ae239"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["_**Expected Outputs**_ \n","```python\n","dna_complementary('ATCGGAATGCC') == 'TAGCCTTACGG'\n","dna_complementary('TCCCGGATCGCATACGAT') == 'AGGGCCTAGCGTATGCTA'\n","dna_complementary('ATCTTATAATTACCGAGTCGATCGG') == 'TAGAATATTAATGGCTCAGCTAGCC'\n","dna_complementary('ATCGGACTACGA') == 'TAGCCTGATGCT'\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"F0QNnjmnMM9p"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## References"],"metadata":{"id":"3bYwQJsqMM9q"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This tutorial was created using the wonderful [Google Python Developers](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) course, and has been modified under the [Creative Common's licence 2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/) \n","\n","Copyright 2010 Google Inc.
