Do not edit or remove the `### START FUNCTION` or `### END FUNCTION` comments. Do not add any code outside of the functions you are required to edit. Doing any of this will lead to a mark of 0%!**\n","- Answer the questions according to the specifications provided.\n","- Use the given cell in each question to to see if your function matches the expected outputs.\n","- Do not hard-code answers to the questions.\n","- The use of stackoverflow, google, and other online tools are permitted.
